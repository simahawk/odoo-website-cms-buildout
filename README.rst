================================
Basic buildout for `website_cms`
================================

Usage::

    # python bootstrap-buildout.py (better if in virtualenv)
    # bin/buildout

Note: if you already have a local checkout of odoo copy it to parts/odoo right after bootstrap -> you will save time! ;)
